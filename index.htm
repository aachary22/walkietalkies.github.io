<h1>Welcome to our Webpage </h1>
<div class="half">
<h3>WHO </h3>
<p> Our target audience are students who have to commute to college campuses by train. According to Northwestern University, 86 percent of college students use public transportation to get to campus. As a result, many students are 
  increasingly becoming stressed due to heavy course loads and commuting only adds to this stress since they could have used their commuting time to be more productive with their coursework.   
    </p>
</div>
<div class="half">
<h3>WHAT </h3>
<p> Commuting by train can be exhausting and even unreliable at times. Metro carts are often crowded, smelly, and can be unsafe if you're unaware of your surrondings. Our solution to get productive work done on the train are keyboard gloves. 
 The keyboard gloves are wearable gloves with buttons attached to them so that a user can type using the glove without taking their laptops out of their bags or using the small keyboard on mobile devices.

	<h3>Pricing</h3>
	<p> The manufacturing price of gloves are $5.20 for each pair.The components that are required for the physical prototype was a small keypad, ardunio, two Lithium Ion batteries($6.95-$9.95), an ATMEGA328 microcontroller ($1.90-$2.08), and two bluetooth transievers($2.99 each).  </p>
	
	</section>
	<section class="one-third"> 
	<h3>Material</h3>
	<p> The glove should be made from polyester and nylon to allow for the technical components to easily fit into place and easy cleaning. The keypad for the prototype is a small 4 by 4 plastic device that connects to an ardunio. For the virtual prototype, AutoCAD software was used to represent the design of the glove.  </p>
	</section>
	<section class="one-third"> 
	<h3>Connectivity</h3>
	<p> The keyboard glove connects wirelessly and the design parameter for this was to have a battery life of up to 5 hours. Furthermore, the glove should be durable and have a waterproof barier to protect the technology from damage.   </p>

	<h1> Looking Towards the Future-Our End Goal </h1>
	<p> For future developments, the end goal would be to create a mini device that attaches to a person's eyewear and when the mini device is connected via bluetooth to a laptop or mobile phone, the device on the eyewear will overlay the computer screen using augmented reality technology.   
	 The gloves paired with the mini device will enable students to work on documents in a more efficent way so that students won't feel like they have wasted time commutung. Furthermore, researching different and efficient keyboard orientation for the glove design is needed for usability of the product in the real world.   </p>

<h1>Research </h1>

<img src="img/chicago1.jpg" alt="chicago01">
<h3> Fact 1 </h3>
<p>  In 2017, the average person in America reported spending about 26 minutes one way commuting. So round-trip, that's 52 minutes of time wasted per day, which equates to 9 days of the year. The average time spent commuting has been rising since 2017.  </p>
</section>
<section class="one-third">
<img src="img/chicago2.jpg" alt="chicago2">
<h3> Fact 2 </h3>
<p>According to the Chicago Transit Authority (CTA), about 1.6 million rides are taken during the weekdays, making it the nation's second largest public transportation system. Furthermore, the CTA'S 1,492 rail cars operate on eight routes, serving 145 stations. </p>
</section>
<section class="one-third">
<img src="img/chicago3.jpg" alt="chicagopic">
<h3> Fact 3 </h3>
<p> Socially, commuting by train takes up a significant portion of time that could be spent doing something productive. At school, a long commute can lead students to feel exhausted and stressed. During the commute, students must also be aware of their surrondings since the 'L' line with the most robberies is State/Lake. </p>
